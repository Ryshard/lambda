My own sandbox project for Angular 2, following tutorial from Lynda.com. 
(https://www.lynda.com/AngularJS-tutorials/AngularJS-2-Essential-Training/422834-2.html)

Based on Angular2 template from:
https://github.com/buckyroberts/angular-2-template


This is a base template for Angular 2. It contains the core files you will need when starting an Angular 2 project.
To get started, follow the instructions below.

### Install Node.js and npm

Download the latest version of Node.js if you do not already have it installed on your machine. This download will also
include the latest version of npm.

https://nodejs.org/en/download/


### Install Libraries and Dependencies

Once you have the files downloaded, navigate into the root project directory and run the following command. This will
install all libraries and dependencies.

`npm install`

### Run the Project

Now you can start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode and run lite-server with automatic refreshing.

`npm start`
